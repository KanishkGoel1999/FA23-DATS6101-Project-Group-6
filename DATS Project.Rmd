## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Read the data:

```{r}
stroke = read.csv("/Users/dineshanandthulasiraman/Documents/Intro to Data Science/full_data.csv")
head(stroke)
tail(stroke)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

**Summary of the Stroke Data**

```{r}
summary_stroke <- xkablesummary(stroke[1, ][c("age","hypertension","heart_disease","stroke")])
summary_stroke
```

**Checking for missing values in the data**

```{r}
missing_values <- is.na(stroke)
summary(missing_values)
```

**Boxplot for Hypertension and heart disease by colour stroke**

** From this This graph we understand that the hypertension soly insn't reason for brain stoke
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(stroke, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Age",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Frequency")
```

**Changing the categorical variable to numeric**

```{r}
#Changing gender to numerical
stroke$gender <- as.numeric(factor(stroke$gender))

#Changing work type to numerical
stroke$work_type <- as.numeric(factor(stroke$work_type))

#Changing the location to numerical
stroke$Residence_type <- as.numeric(factor(stroke$Residence_type))
head(stroke)
tail(stroke)
```
