## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Read the data:

```{r}
stroke = read.csv("/Users/dineshanandthulasiraman/Documents/Intro to Data Science/full_data.csv")
head(stroke)
tail(stroke)
```

**Summary of the Stroke Data**

```{r}
summary_stroke <- xkablesummary(stroke[1, ][c("age","hypertension","heart_disease","stroke")])
summary_stroke
```

**Checking for missing values in the data**

```{r}
missing_values <- is.na(stroke)
summary(missing_values)
```

**Changing the categorical variable to numeric**

```{r}
#Changing gender to numerical
stroke$gender <- as.numeric(factor(stroke$gender))

#Changing work type to numerical
stroke$work_type <- as.numeric(factor(stroke$work_type))

#Changing the location to numerical
stroke$Residence_type <- as.numeric(factor(stroke$Residence_type))
head(stroke)
tail(stroke)
```

**Box plot for Hypertension and heart disease by color stroke**

**From this graph we understand that the brain stroke increase with increase in age and at some point it decreases and it raise once again**
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(stroke, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  ggtitle("Use theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) to center") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Age",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Frequency")
```

**The effect of average glucose level in stroke**

**From this graph we understand that the females has more stroke compared to male**
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
stroke$gender_label <- factor(ifelse(stroke$gender == 1, "male", "female"), levels = c("male", "female"))
ggplot(stroke, aes(y = gender_label, x = avg_glucose_level, color = stroke)) +
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Use theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) to center") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Average Glucose Level and Gender",y = "Gender", x = "Avg_glucose_level")
```

**From this graph we understand that the average BMI Count of both gender is under 35 approximately**
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(stroke, aes(x = gender, y = bmi, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Box Plot of BMI by Gender",
    x = "Gender",
    y = "BMI"
  )
```
