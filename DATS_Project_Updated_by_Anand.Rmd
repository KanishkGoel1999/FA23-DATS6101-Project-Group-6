## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Read the data:

```{r}
stroke = read.csv("full_data.csv")
head(stroke)
tail(stroke)
```

**Summary of the Stroke Data**

```{r}
summary_stroke <- xkablesummary(stroke[1, ][c("age","hypertension","heart_disease","stroke")])
summary_stroke
```

**Checking for missing values in the data**

```{r}
missing_values <- is.na(stroke)
summary(missing_values)
```

**Changing the work_type children to unemployed**

```{r}
stroke$work_type <- ifelse(stroke$work_type == "children", "unemployed", stroke$work_type)
print(head(stroke))
```

**Changing the all categorical variable to numeric variables**

```{r}
#Changing gender to numerical
stroke$gender <- as.numeric(factor(stroke$gender))

#Changing work type to numerical
stroke$work_type <- as.numeric(factor(stroke$work_type))

#Changing the location to numerical
stroke$Residence_type <- as.numeric(factor(stroke$Residence_type))

#Changing the marriage status to numerical
stroke$ever_married <- as.numeric(factor(stroke$ever_married))

#Changing the smoking status to numerical
stroke$smoking_status <- as.numeric(factor(stroke$smoking_status))

final <- stroke
head(final)
tail(final)
```

**Introducing the Age Categories**

```{r}
age_breaks <- c(0, 10, 18, 60, Inf)
age_labels <- c("Children", "School", "Adult", "Senior Citizen")

# Create a new column with age categories
stroke$Category <- cut(stroke$age, breaks = age_breaks, labels = age_labels)

# Print the dataset
print(head(stroke))

```



**Histogram for distribution for Age**

**From this graph we understand that there are more people from age group 40-60**
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(stroke, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  ggtitle("Use theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) to center") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Age",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Frequency")
```

**The effect of average glucose level in stroke**

**From this graph we understand that the females has more average glucose level compared to male**
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
stroke$gender_label <- factor(ifelse(stroke$gender == 1, "male", "female"), levels = c("male", "female"))
ggplot(stroke, aes(y = gender_label, x = avg_glucose_level, color = stroke)) +
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Use theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) to center") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Average Glucose Level and Gender",y = "Gender", x = "Avg_glucose_level")
```

**From this graph we understand that the average BMI Count of both gender is under 35 approximately**

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(stroke, aes(x = gender, y = bmi, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Box Plot of BMI by Gender",
    x = "Gender",
    y = "BMI"
  )
```

**What are the age-specific incidence and mortality rates of brain stroke?**

Null Hypothesis(H0): Age and stroke variables are independent.

Alternative Hypothesis(Ha): Age and stroke are not independent.

```{r Chi-Square Test to determine if brain stroke and age group are independent, include=TRUE}
Contingency_Table_Age <- table(stroke$Category , stroke$stroke)
Chi_Square_Test_Age_BS <- chisq.test(Contingency_Table_Age)
print(Chi_Square_Test_Age_BS$p.value)
```

The p-value for this test is <0.05 (Standard Significane level), therefore we reject Null Hypothesis. 
Hence we can conclude that Age and stroke are not independent.
Age group significantly matters in chances of having a brain stroke.

**Which category in age has highest number of Brain Strokes**

```{r Highest brain strokes in which category, include=TRUE}
print(Contingency_Table_Age)

```

```{r}
brain_stroke_yes <- subset(stroke,stroke == 1)
brain_stroke_no <- subset(stroke,stroke == 0)
```

```{r Visualization for highest number of deaths in age category, include=TRUE}
ggplot(data = brain_stroke_yes, aes(x = `Category`, fill = `Category`)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack",col="black", fill="Orange") +
  labs(title = "Brain Strokes by Age Category",
       x = "Age Category",
       y = "Count of Brain Strokes") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

```{r Percentage wise barplot for Age Category, include=TRUE}
library(dplyr)

# Calculate the total number of cases
total_cases <- nrow(brain_stroke_yes)

# Calculate the percentage of brain strokes for each age category
brain_stroke_yes_percentage <- brain_stroke_yes %>%
  group_by(Category) %>%
  summarise(Percentage = (n() / total_cases) * 100)

# Create the bar plot with percentages
ggplot(data = brain_stroke_yes_percentage, aes(x = `Category`, y = Percentage, fill = `Category`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", col = "black", width = 0.7, position = "stack") +
  labs(title = "Brain Strokes by Age Category (Percentage)",
       x = "Age Category",
       y = "Percentage of Brain Strokes") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +  # Format y-axis as percentage
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```

The "Senior Citizen" age group exhibits the highest likelihood of experiencing a brain stroke, accounting for nearly 70% of cases

**What is the case fatality rate of stroke by gender, location, and work type**

Null Hypothesis(H0): Worktype and stroke variables are independent.

Alternative Hypothesis(Ha): Worktype and stroke are not independent.

```{r Chi-Square Test to determine if brain stroke and wortype are independent, include=TRUE}
Contingency_Table_worktype <- table(stroke$work_type , stroke$stroke)
Chi_Square_Test_worktype_BS <- chisq.test(Contingency_Table_worktype)
print(Chi_Square_Test_worktype_BS$p.value)
```

The p-value for this test is <0.05 (Standard Significane level), therefore we reject Null Hypothesis. 
Hence we can conclude that worktype and stroke are not independent.
Worktype significantly matters in chances of having a brain stroke.


**Which category in worktype has highest number of Brain Strokes***
```{r Visualization for highest number of deaths in worktype category, include=TRUE}
ggplot(data = brain_stroke_yes, aes(x = `work_type`, fill = `work_type`)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack",col="black", fill="Green",show.legend = TRUE) +
  labs(title = "Brain Strokes by Worktype Category",
       x = "Work Type",
       y = "Count of Brain Strokes") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("1" = "blue", "2" = "green", "3" = "red", "4" = "purple"),
                    labels = c("Government Job", "Private", "Self Employed", "Children")) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
```{r Percentage Wise barplot for Worktype, include=TRUE}

brain_stroke_yes <- brain_stroke_yes %>%
  mutate(work_type_named = case_when(
    work_type == 1 ~ "Government Job",
    work_type == 2 ~ "Private",
    work_type == 3 ~ "Self-Employed",
    work_type == 4 ~ "Children"
  ))


# Calculate the percentage of brain strokes for each age category
brain_stroke_yes_percentage <- brain_stroke_yes %>%
  group_by(work_type_named) %>%
  summarise(Percentage = (n() / total_cases) * 100)

# Create the bar plot with percentages
ggplot(data = brain_stroke_yes_percentage, aes(x = `work_type_named`, y = Percentage, fill = `work_type_named`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", col = "black", width = 0.7, position = "stack") +
  labs(title = "Brain Strokes by Worktype (Percentage)",
       x = "Worktype",
       y = "Percentage of Brain Strokes") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +  # Format y-axis as percentage
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```

The highest number of Brain strokes is for the Private working people.

**Does brain stroke depend on gender type?**

Null Hypothesis(H0): Gender and stroke variables are independent.

Alternative Hypothesis(Ha): Gender and stroke are not independent.

```{r Chi-Square Test to determine if brain stroke and Worktype are independent, include=TRUE}
Contingency_Table_Gender <- table(stroke$gender , stroke$stroke)
Chi_Square_Test_Gender_BS <- chisq.test(Contingency_Table_Gender)
print(Chi_Square_Test_Gender_BS$p.value)
```

```{r Percentage wise stroke for Gender, include=TRUE}

# Calculate the percentage of brain strokes for each gender category
brain_stroke_yes_percentage <- brain_stroke_yes %>%
  group_by(gender_label) %>%
  summarise(Percentage = (n() / total_cases) * 100)

# Create the bar plot with percentages on the y-axis
ggplot(data = brain_stroke_yes_percentage, aes(x = gender_label, y = Percentage, fill = gender_label)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", col = "black", width = 0.7, position = "stack") +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Strokes by Gender",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "Percentage of Strokes") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +  # Format y-axis as percentage
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```

p-value is greater than 0.05 (Standard Significance level) and therefore we accept Null Hypothesis and so 
we can conclude that brain stroke doesn't depend on gender type.

**Does brain stroke depend on Location type?**

Null Hypothesis(H0): Location and stroke variables are independent.

Alternative Hypothesis(Ha): Location and stroke are not independent.

```{r Chi-Square Test to determine if brain stroke and Location are independent, include=TRUE}
Contingency_Table_Location <- table(stroke$Residence_type , stroke$stroke)
Chi_Square_Test_Location_BS <- chisq.test(Contingency_Table_Location)
print(Chi_Square_Test_Location_BS$p.value)
```

p-value is greater than 0.05 (Standard Significance level) and therefore we accept Null Hypothesis and so 
we can conclude that brain stroke doesn't depend on Location of residence.

```{r Percentage wise stroke for Location, include=TRUE}

brain_stroke_yes <- brain_stroke_yes %>%
  mutate(Residence_type = case_when(
    Residence_type == 1 ~ "Rural",
    Residence_type == 2 ~ "Urban"
  ))

# Calculate the percentage of brain strokes for each location category
brain_stroke_yes_percentage <- brain_stroke_yes %>%
  group_by(Residence_type) %>%
  summarise(Percentage = (n() / total_cases) * 100)

# Create the bar plot with percentages on the y-axis
ggplot(data = brain_stroke_yes_percentage, aes(x = Residence_type, y = Percentage, fill = Residence_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", col = "black", width = 0.7, position = "stack") +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Strokes by Residence type",
       x = "Type of Residence",
       y = "Percentage of Strokes") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +  # Format y-axis as percentage
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
